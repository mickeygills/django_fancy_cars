    This is a top-level method, and thereâ€™s one for each HTTP verb - 
    get(), post(), patch(), etc. You would override it when you want 
    to do something before a request is processed by the view, or after. 
    But this is only called when a form view is loaded for the first time, 
    not when the form is submitted. Basic example in the documentation. 
    By default it will just render the configured template and return the HTML.
